# DateSorter

This Java project provides an implementation for sorting a collection of dates based on specific sorting criteria. The main sorting criteria are as follows:

- Dates with a month containing a specified letter are sorted in ascending order.
- Dates with a month not containing the specified letter are sorted in descending order.

## Usage

To sort dates in your Java project, use the `sortDates` method found in the `DateSorter` class. This method takes an unsorted list of dates as input and returns a list of dates sorted according to the given criteria.
